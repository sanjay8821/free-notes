                                                  write a blog on difference between document and window objects
  
                   A document is an object inside the window object and we use a document object for manipulation inside the document. The first thing that gets loaded into
                       the browser is the window and the properties related to that window are stored in the window object



                                                                          document object
           
                         The document object represent  a web page that is loaded in the browser by accessing the document, we can access the element in the html
                          page, with the help of document object we can add dynamic content to our web page the document object can be accessed with a window.document 

                                                                             syntex
